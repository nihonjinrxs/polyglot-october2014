# Manipulating Data in Style with SQL
##### An introduction to SQL, the interface language to most of the worldâ€™s structured data, and practices for readable and reusable SQL code

This repository contains materials for [my talk at the Polyglot Programming DC meetup on October 14, 2014](http://www.meetup.com/Polyglot-Programming-DC/events/208670052/), which is loosely based on material from my talks at the Data Wranglers DC meetups on [June 4, 2014](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Wranglers-DC/events/171768162/) ([materials at nihonjinrxs/dwdc-june2014](http://www.github.com/nihonjinrxs/dwdc-june2014)) and [August 6, 2014](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Wranglers-DC/events/177269432/) ([materials at nihonjinrxs/dwdc-august2014](http://www.github.com/nihonjinrxs/dwdc-august2014)).

### Contents
The talk consists of two major directions:
- An introduction to SQL and relational databases, and techniques for writing readable and reusable code in SQL
- Using SQL on Data Frame objects in R and Python

Folders are as follows:
- A slide deck (`./slides`) in Apple Keynote, [PDF](http://nihonjinrxs.github.io/polyglot-october2014/Polyglot-October2014-RyanHarvey.pdf) and [HTML](http://nihonjinrxs.github.io/polyglot-october2014) formats
- A set of SQL scripts (`./sql`) that demonstrate the queries discussed, as well as the creation of database objects such as views and functions
- An RMarkdown document (`./R`), [published on RPubs](http://rpubs.com/ryanbharvey/polyglot-october2014), that demonstrates using `sqldf` in R to perform SQL queries on data frames as if they are tables
- An IPython notebook (`./python`), [available at IPython nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/nihonjinrxs/polyglot-october2014/blob/master/python/sqldf_examples_python.ipynb), that demonstrates using `sqldf` from the `pandasql` package to perform SQL queries on Pandas DataFrame objects as if they are tables

### Where do I start?
I recommend that anyone wishing to understand what I've done should tackle these pieces in order, starting with the slide deck.  In order to work with the code examples, you'll need [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) (I used version 9.3 on an Apple Mac to create these examples) and the [Chinook Database](http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/) ([MS-PL licensed](http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/license)).  You may also want to review the [Chinook data model and schema](http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Chinook_Schema&referringTitle=Home).
